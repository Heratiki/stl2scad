# STL2SCAD Debug Feature Implementation

## Current Status

1. Added debug feature to compare STL and SCAD outputs:
   - Side-by-side view of original STL and converted SCAD
   - Measurement rulers for visual comparison
   - Statistics about vertex reduction and optimization

2. OpenSCAD Integration:
   - Added version checking for OpenSCAD Nightly (requires 25.02.19 or later)
   - Configured PowerShell command execution for Windows
   - Set up proper file path handling with quotes

3. Debug Output Files:
   - `*_debug.scad`: Side-by-side comparison file
   - `*_analysis.json`: Geometry statistics
   - `*_debug.echo`: OpenSCAD console output
   - `*_preview.png`: Visual preview
   - Added cleanup of old debug files

## Next Steps

1. Test and verify OpenSCAD command execution:
   - Ensure PowerShell commands work correctly
   - Verify all debug files are generated
   - Check file path handling with spaces

2. Potential Improvements:
   - Add more measurement tools in SCAD preview
   - Consider adding bounding box visualization
   - Add option to save comparison metrics
   - Consider automated geometry validation

3. Documentation Needed:
   - Document debug feature usage in README
   - Add examples of debug output interpretation
   - List required OpenSCAD version and features

## Requirements

- OpenSCAD (Nightly) version 25.02.19 or later
- PowerShell for Windows systems
- Python dependencies: numpy, numpy-stl

## Notes

The debug feature aims to help verify conversion accuracy by:
1. Showing original STL and converted SCAD side by side
2. Providing measurement tools for comparison
3. Generating statistics about the conversion
4. Creating visual previews for quick verification

This helps users ensure that the SCAD output matches the original STL geometry.
